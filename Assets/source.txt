VkInstance: Connection between Vulkan library and application. API context

VkPhysicalDevice: Information about GPUs available

VkDevice: The GPU driver that allows communication with the GPU

Queue family: Set of queues and what their properties are. A queue will support certain commands
depending on the queue family it originates from. A queue is where commands are submitted for 
execution on the GPU. 

VkQueue: A queue is where commands are submitted for execution, in this case the graphics queue. 
Different queues can be executed in parallel. 

VkDescriptorPool: A pool of descriptors from which descriptor sets can be allocated.

	Descriptors are like a pointer to a resource, such as a buffer or an image.
	
	Descriptor sets are allocated in GPU VRAM, and a descriptor set are multitple 
	descriptors bound together

VkRenderPass: Magic. Only exists in Vulkan. Allows the driver to know more about the images
being rendered. 

VkImage: Contains pixel data. Preferably stored on GPU

	Image Count: # of Images within the swapchain ??

VkSampleCountFlagBits: Number of sample points within a pixel that can be used for anti-aliasing. 


VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo struct

	flags: VkDescriptorPoolCreateFlagBits -> bitmask specifying supported operations on a descriptor pool

	maxsets: maximum number of descriptor sets that can be allocated in a descriptor pool

	poolsizecounts: number of elements in the pPoolSizes

	pPoolSizes: pointer to an array of VkDescriptorPoolSize structs

		VkDescriptorPoolSize: 
			
			type: type of descriptor

			descriptorCount: Number of bytes to allocate for type of descriptor
